2. I honestly don't know how much of the network multiplayer game I created properly, I really struggled with this project. I gave it all my time with the last week while doing my Operating Systems and Wireless Network finals. I couldn't wrap my head around it but I did try my best, sorry for this attempt however. 
3. In order to enter the games "server", the user needs to enter the correct IP address. Then the player(s) can move with the WASD keys, and shoot with the E key. The goal is to complete each of the maps by 'shooting' the enemies, if all maps are completed then the player(s) wins. The player loses if they lose all their lives before completing all the maps. The enemies will be removed if they are 'shot', run into walls, or run into eachother. The player(s) will be removed if they run into a wall, run into an enemy, or are 'shot' by the enemy.
